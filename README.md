Official implementation for honors project: **Enhancing GNNs with Spectral Decomposition**


## Abstract
Message passing neural networks achieved great success in a wide range of applications, but the expressive power of such models are bounded by 1-WL test. Spectrum of graph contains the critical structural information that is hard to capture via message pass- ing process. But decomposing an entire graph to get spectrum has high computation complexity. Hence, we propose to use spectrum of local subgraphs. In this thesis, I first propose two spectral features that contain local structural information derived from spectrum of local subgraphs. Secondly, I propose four integration methods that improve general message passing neural networks with spectral features.
